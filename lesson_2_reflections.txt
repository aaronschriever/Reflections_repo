How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers you an opportunity to see what does and doesnt need to be in the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add a single file change even if more than one has changed before the commit. You can pick and choose what is commited 
to make more sense.
