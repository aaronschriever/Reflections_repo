How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers you an opportunity to see what does and doesnt need to be in the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add a single file change even if more than one has changed before the commit. You can pick and choose what is commited 
to make more sense.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when changing different parts of the project, and being able to check those changes which have been made
to that part of the project instead of the entire project itself. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Shows how the history of the git commits works, so you can see the linear fashion that the commits are formed in. If you have a branch then there
is that new line off to the side which will not see anything on the old branch (eg master) commited after where it joins.
