When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with fellow coders. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to work on a certain commit from the remote, also it stops things changing on you which may effect the code you are writing. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: copy of existin repo on github to your github account
clone: copy of existing repo on github or local to your local repo
branch: commits which are made off the master with different code leaving the master in tact

fork - when changes will be made but not integrated into the original repo
clone - when you would like a local copy of a repo to work on the repo.
branch - when writing experimental code or new features to a program which are not ready to be included on the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

helps with merging later on because you can see what has changed since the last pull and if there will be an issue arising from this. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

USB sticks with the files on them, email etc. may be easier to do some merges, a lot harder to track changes and bugs though
