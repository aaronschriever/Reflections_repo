When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with fellow coders. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to work on a certain commit from the remote, also it stops things changing on you which may effect the code you are writing.
